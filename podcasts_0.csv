We analyze romance novels and movies to better imagine our own happy endings. Episodes release weekly on Tuesdays.CURRENT SEASON: Hot and Bothered (Movie Edition)We make Hot and Bothered because we are interested in the way that love stories have impacted our lives and culture. For our fifth season of the show, we’re turning our attention to romantic films. Vanessa and Hannah McGregor dig into the canon of romantic films, from Titanic to Twilight to When Harry Met Sally, (just to name a few). Every other week they do a close scene analysis of how each movie ends, always asking the question ‘what does this movie believe about love?’SEASON 4: Live from PemberleyIn Live from Pemberley, we continue our deep-dive into the classic texts of romance literature. This season we take a close look at the most famous Romance novel of all time: Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. Every episode, Vanessa Zoltan and Lauren Sandler read through the book, talk with experts, and ask themselves the question ‘is this still a story for our time?’SEASON 3: On EyreVanessa Zoltan and journalist Lauren Sandler embark on the English class you always deserved, diving deep into Jane Eyre through the themes of power and desire. Discussions range from ideas of class and colonialism to sex and gender as Lauren and Vanessa explore the roles of oppression and inequality, empowerment and rebellion in the text. Major “Eyreheads” and first-time readers alike are invited into Lauren and Vanessa’s conversation as they grapple with this complicated work—and as they try to figure out if Jane Eyre is a book they want to pass on to their daughters, and to future generations.SEASON 2: Twilight in QuarantineYou may remember BFFs Vanessa & Julia from their all-star advice giving in Hot and Bothered Season 1. In this season they’re sheltering in place in different cities, but they’re getting on the phone three times a week to read and talk about Twilight. On Twilight in Quarantine, they work their way through the Twilight saga one chapter at a time, giving brilliant well-informed advice to Stephenie Meyer’s characters along the way. Advice like: “have you considered talking to each other about your feelings?” and “maybe you shouldn’t kidnap people.”SEASON 1: Writing RomanceSeason one of Hot and Bothered follows ten first-time romance writers as they try to write their own romance novels. Each episode explores a particular romance trope and why we love it so much. Along the way, Julia Quinn, writer of the Bridgerton series, gives weekly assignments so listeners can follow along in the process. Season one was made in collaboration with Spoke Media.Hot & Bothered is produced by Not Sorry Productions, a feminist organization that produces podcasts, educational content, live shows, and immersive experiences with the explicit goal of addressing the spiritual needs of its participants. Through community, rigor, and ritual, we treat traditionally secular things as if they were sacred. To learn more about what we do, visit https://notsorryworks.com/ Hosted on Acast.

The Emerald advocates for an imaginative vision of human life and human discourse as it questions deep underlying assumptions about societal progress."

We analyze romance novels and movies to better imagine our own happy endings. Episodes release weekly on Tuesdays.CURRENT SEASON: Hot and Bothered (Movie Edition)We make Hot and Bothered because we are interested in the way that love stories have impacted our lives and culture. For our fifth season of the show, we’re turning our attention to romantic films. Vanessa and Hannah McGregor dig into the canon of romantic films, from Titanic to Twilight to When Harry Met Sally, (just to name a few). Every other week they do a close scene analysis of how each movie ends, always asking the question ‘what does this movie believe about love?’SEASON 4: Live from PemberleyIn Live from Pemberley, we continue our deep-dive into the classic texts of romance literature. This season we take a close look at the most famous Romance novel of all time: Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. Every episode, Vanessa Zoltan and Lauren Sandler read through the book, talk with experts, and ask themselves the question ‘is this still a story for our time?’SEASON 3: On EyreVanessa Zoltan and journalist Lauren Sandler embark on the English class you always deserved, diving deep into Jane Eyre through the themes of power and desire. Discussions range from ideas of class and colonialism to sex and gender as Lauren and Vanessa explore the roles of oppression and inequality, empowerment and rebellion in the text. Major “Eyreheads” and first-time readers alike are invited into Lauren and Vanessa’s conversation as they grapple with this complicated work—and as they try to figure out if Jane Eyre is a book they want to pass on to their daughters, and to future generations.SEASON 2: Twilight in QuarantineYou may remember BFFs Vanessa & Julia from their all-star advice giving in Hot and Bothered Season 1. In this season they’re sheltering in place in different cities, but they’re getting on the phone three times a week to read and talk about Twilight. On Twilight in Quarantine, they work their way through the Twilight saga one chapter at a time, giving brilliant well-informed advice to Stephenie Meyer’s characters along the way. Advice like: “have you considered talking to each other about your feelings?” and “maybe you shouldn’t kidnap people.”SEASON 1: Writing RomanceSeason one of Hot and Bothered follows ten first-time romance writers as they try to write their own romance novels. Each episode explores a particular romance trope and why we love it so much. Along the way, Julia Quinn, writer of the Bridgerton series, gives weekly assignments so listeners can follow along in the process. Season one was made in collaboration with Spoke Media.Hot & Bothered is produced by Not Sorry Productions, a feminist organization that produces podcasts, educational content, live shows, and immersive experiences with the explicit goal of addressing the spiritual needs of its participants. Through community, rigor, and ritual, we treat traditionally secular things as if they were sacred. To learn more about what we do, visit https://notsorryworks.com/ Hosted on Acast.

At the heart of the podcast is the premise that the imaginative, poetic, animate heart of human experience — elucidated by so many cultures over so many thousands of years — is missing in modern discourse and is urgently needed at a time when humanity is facing unprecedented problems. The Emerald advocates for an imaginative vision of human life and human discourse as it questions deep underlying assumptions about societal progress."

Christie was a master storyteller, and her radio plays are full of twists and turns that keep the listener guessing until the very end.Her characters are complex and believable. Christie's characters are more than just archetypes; they are flawed and relatable individuals.Her radio plays are well-acted and produced.

We enter a ""great conversation"" amongst the most learned, intelligent humans in history and benefit from their insights.Is this for first-time readers?YES. Our goal is to host meaningful conversations on the Great Books by working through the texts in chronological order in a slow, attentive manner. Our host Adam Minihan is a first-time reader of Homer. We will start shallow and go deep. All are invited to join.Will any resources be available?YES.

R. Martin has put a lot of effort and thought into creating a deeper dimension of archetype and symbol in his writing. He’s created connections between past and future, between sky and ground. He’s built on classic figures from world mythology and twisted them around in new and incredible ways to fashion his own archetypal characters whose divine roles are played out by the characters in the story. He’s done all of this not only to be artistic and clever, but because he’s actually participating in a grand tradition of esoteric, symbolic art. Keeping this tradition alive is of critical importance and tremendous value to society, and that is why I believe this facet of A Song of Ice and Fire is so worthy of study. This podcast is intended to be our vehicle to explore these inner workings, and it is fueled by enthusiasm, yours and mine."

R. Martin has put a lot of effort and thought into creating a deeper dimension of archetype and symbol in his writing. He’s created connections between past and future, between sky and ground. He’s built on classic figures from world mythology and twisted them around in new and incredible ways to fashion his own archetypal characters whose divine roles are played out by the characters in the story. He’s done all of this not only to be artistic and clever, but because he’s actually participating in a grand tradition of esoteric, symbolic art. Keeping this tradition alive is of critical importance and tremendous value to society, and that is why I believe this facet of A Song of Ice and Fire is so worthy of study.

But beyond its obsession with the ubiquitous-yet-obscure book series, SWEET VALLEY DIARIES is a podcast about nostalgia — '80s nostalgia in particular — and the ways this nostalgia can (spectacularly, hilariously) fail us. It's a riotous cultural conversation about which parts of the past we long for and which ones we want to leave behind for good. It's about friendship, honesty, and learning to speak your truth in the face of a boyfriend-stealing cheerleader or an evil triplet. It's all the life lessons you could ever hope to learn from two size-6, blonde-haired, aqua-eyed, identical 16-year-old twins. Strap in."

Set at the turn of the 19th century, Pride and Prejudice catches a perfect glimpse not only of a time when women were socially and economically dependent solely on their marital status, but also as an age of enlightenment and witness of the French Revolution.This romantic novel with its hint of comic references begins with the famous quote ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""This famous quotation sets the story into motion as the eligible Mr. Bingley is introduced as he rides into town. The quote also draws in and to some extent reveals the content of the plot to come. Soon the news of the arrival of the well off Charles Bingley finds its way to the ears of the Bennett household. Having five unmarried daughters, the Bennetts are eager to match them up with suitable spouse candidates and see them prosperously married. After attending a ball, Mr. Bingley is instantly attracted to the oldest Bennett daughter Jane and it is fair to say that the feeling is mutual. Such cannot be said about his close friend Mr. Darcy who rudely refuses to dance with the second Bennett daughter Elizabeth. Consequently, Elizabeth’s first prejudice is born as she labels Mr. Darcy arrogant and obnoxious; however, she later learns never to judge a book by its cover and must swallow up her pride to achieve happiness. Pride and Prejudice witnesses the exciting courtships of the Bennett sisters and their suitors, as well as the not so joyful relationships of other characters. As the novel develops the relationships between the characters must outweigh the forces seeking to tear them apart. Experience the adventures of the Bennett sisters as they face the troublesome issues of manners, social class, family, and marriages in a male reliant society. A story not only portraying the unreliable nature of pride and prejudice, Austen’s classic also paints a vivid image of the past and the woman as a member of society."

Poirot agrees and soon begins unraveling the complex web of secrets, lies, and hidden motives among the inhabitants of King's Abbot.What makes ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" so remarkable is its innovative narrative technique. The novel is famous for its unreliable narrator, Dr. Sheppard, who recounts the events and becomes Poirot's confidant throughout the investigation. Readers are kept in the dark until the final chapters when Poirot gathers all the suspects and unveils the truth in a dramatic reveal.Agatha Christie's skillful plotting and the unexpected twist ending have made ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" a classic in the mystery genre. It is often cited as one of her most ingenious and controversial works due to the audacious narrative choice Christie made in selecting Dr. Sheppard as the narrator. The novel remains a favorite among Christie's fans and is celebrated for its contribution to the evolution of detective fiction."

These are just a few examples of the many radio adaptations of Agatha Christie's work. Her stories are perfectly suited for radio, with their complex plots, suspenseful twists and turns, and memorable characters. Christie's radio plays have been enjoyed by audiences for generations, and they continue to be popular today. They are a great way to experience her classic mysteries in a new and exciting way. Here are some of the reasons why Agatha Christie's radio plays are so popular:Her stories are well-crafted and suspenseful. Christie was a master storyteller, and her radio plays are full of twists and turns that keep the listener guessing until the very end.Her characters are complex and believable. Christie's characters are more than just archetypes; they are flawed and relatable individuals.Her radio plays are well-acted and produced. Many of the best radio actors of their time have appeared in Christie's radio plays, and the productions are always high-quality.If you are a fan of Agatha Christie, or if you simply enjoy a good mystery, I highly recommend checking out some of her radio plays. You won't be disappointed."

It shadows the experiences of detective Sherlock Holmes, an enigmatic genius, as he tries to unravel the mystery of each investigation he partakes in. Set in late 19th century London, the novel not only creates a successful mystery plot, but also circulates through real locations including Hyde Park, the river Thames, St George’s Church in Hanover Square, as well as adding fictional places to spice things up.  The vibrant reoccurring illustrations of London’s means of transportation are also worth noting.   The novel begins in the famous apartment 221B Baker Street, home to Sherlock Holmes who is visited by clients in need of assistance in resolving various issues. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock Holmes works his magic in order to find a logical solution to each mystery.  Narrated through the perspective of Dr. Watson, Holmes’s close friend and companion, he serves as a monitor as he accompanies or is given a full account of the sequence of events surrounding investigation details.  Watson then documents each adventure and shares it with the readers which in turn act as memoirs of Holmes’s achievements. This type of narration only enhances the sense of mystery surrounding each case because of the occasional missing detail and leaves the reader wondering about the next course of action. Interestingly, Holmes offers logical explanations for each of his solutions, but nevertheless manages to keep the audience on their toes. Family fortune, reputation, social status and moral weakness are just some of the themes Doyle explores in his novel of suspense and mystery.  Doyle’s use of 19th century English jargon proves to be a delightful read, whilst still maintaining a lucid style easy to follow and understand. For those embarking on their first ever encounter with the pipe-smoking, violin-playing sleuth, this is just the beginning of an unforgettable journey."

Complex construction jargon and best practices will be explained in easy to understand terms.  It’s not the typical DIY (do it yourself) show.  You will learn how to MANAGE the labor, not DO the labor for your new house.Join me, Michelle Nelson, host and fellow informal residential construction student.  I’ll share the research I find on home design and building as I prepare to build my home. Together, our community of future home builders, will learn the tips, tricks and trends of experienced contractors and industry experts. I’ll interview owner-builders and construction professionals.  During our mini lessons, I’ll inform you about framing, flooring, windows, insulation, kitchen cabinets and countertops…almost anything having to do with new construction homes.  You’ll hear about energy efficiency and green building too.  There will be product reviews in which you will be introduced to cutting edge, as well as, tried and true products and services.  And in keeping with the university theme, episodes will end with short, fun quizzes. If we do our due diligence BEFORE we start construction, we will actually start construction with the most difficult part of the project behind us.  Let’s put in the time, effort, preparation and research BEFORE we break ground and building our homes will be much easier and more enjoyable."

Build Your House Yourself University (byhyu) will teach you to save money and make smart decisions about the construction of the place you and your family will call HOME. We will help you understand residential construction— simplify and demystify the design build process. You’ll come away with successful strategies for building your own house, with or without a general contractor.  Become an educated consumer, even if you prefer to buy, rather than build a new house. Complex construction jargon and best practices will be explained in easy to understand terms.  It’s not the typical DIY (do it yourself) show.  You will learn how to MANAGE the labor, not DO the labor for your new house.Join me, Michelle Nelson, host and fellow informal residential construction student.  I’ll share the research I find on home design and building as I prepare to build my home. Together, our community of future home builders, will learn the tips, tricks and trends of experienced contractors and industry experts. I’ll interview owner-builders and construction professionals.  During our mini lessons, I’ll inform you about framing, flooring, windows, insulation, kitchen cabinets and countertops…almost anything having to do with new construction homes.  You’ll hear about energy efficiency and green building too.  There will be product reviews in which you will be introduced to cutting edge, as well as, tried and true products and services.  And in keeping with the university theme, episodes will end with short, fun quizzes. If we do our due diligence BEFORE we start construction, we will actually start construction with the most difficult part of the project behind us.  Let’s put in the time, effort, preparation and research BEFORE we break ground and building our homes will be much easier and more enjoyable."

In the process of growing my business I’ve been fortunate enough to connect with women of all different types and from all different fields. And the main lesson I’ve learnt is that we are all just improvising. We’re going around doing the best we can with what we’ve got, feeling self conscious about what everyone else is accomplishing.

Please,Arts,3 episodes,,,"n the wacky world of Floridian politics, Governor Ron ""Heels"" DeSantis has found himself in a bit of a pickle—or should we say, in a bit of a platform shoe? The Sunshine State's head honcho has been caught up in a scandal that's got more lift than a NASA rocket—yep, it's ""Bootgate,"" the saga that's got everyone looking down instead of up for a change.So, what's the tall tale? Well, it seems that DeSantis has been accused of giving his height a bit of a gubernatorial boost, thanks to some sneaky shoe inserts. That's right, the man's been elevating more than just taxes! And who do we have to thank for this juicy tidbit? None other than the former Tweeter-in-Chief, Donald Trump, who's been throwing shade taller than the alleged lifts themselves.The whole hullabaloo stepped into the spotlight with a Politico exposé that had more cobblers in a tizzy than a sale at Shoe Carnival. These sole-searching sleuths claimed that DeSantis's boots were more stacked than a pancake breakfast at IHOP.Now, DeSantis, standing at a reported 5'11"" (on a good hair day), swears on his mother's recipe for key lime pie that he's as lift-free as a Florida alligator's belly. But, he's been as shy about a barefoot measurement as a catfish is about a beauty pageant.The ""Bootgate"" brouhaha has been the gift that keeps on giving for his high-heeled haters. They're eating it up like a tourist with a Publix sub, saying these lifts aren't just for his feet, but for his lofty political dreams, too. They reckon he's trying to stand toe-to-toe with the big boys on the national stage—literally.DeSantis, for his part, isn't letting this scandal stomp on his spirit. He's been strutting into speeches with more jokes about his footwear than a stand-up comedian at a shoe store. But whether this scandal will scuff his political prospects or just add another inch to his infamous reputation, only time will tell.So, will ""Bootgate"" be the thing that trips up Governor DeSantis, or will he rise above it—elevator shoes and all? Stay tuned, folks. It's Florida, after all, where the only thing higher than the humidity is the next chapter of ""Bootgate."""

Please,Arts,3 episodes,,,"n the wacky world of Floridian politics, Governor Ron ""Heels"" DeSantis has found himself in a bit of a pickle—or should we say, in a bit of a platform shoe? The Sunshine State's head honcho has been caught up in a scandal that's got more lift than a NASA rocket—yep, it's ""Bootgate,"" the saga that's got everyone looking down instead of up for a change.So, what's the tall tale? Well, it seems that DeSantis has been accused of giving his height a bit of a gubernatorial boost, thanks to some sneaky shoe inserts. That's right, the man's been elevating more than just taxes! And who do we have to thank for this juicy tidbit? None other than the former Tweeter-in-Chief, Donald Trump, who's been throwing shade taller than the alleged lifts themselves.The whole hullabaloo stepped into the spotlight with a Politico exposé that had more cobblers in a tizzy than a sale at Shoe Carnival. These sole-searching sleuths claimed that DeSantis's boots were more stacked than a pancake breakfast at IHOP.Now, DeSantis, standing at a reported 5'11"" (on a good hair day), swears on his mother's recipe for key lime pie that he's as lift-free as a Florida alligator's belly. But, he's been as shy about a barefoot measurement as a catfish is about a beauty pageant.The ""Bootgate"" brouhaha has been the gift that keeps on giving for his high-heeled haters. They're eating it up like a tourist with a Publix sub, saying these lifts aren't just for his feet, but for his lofty political dreams, too. They reckon he's trying to stand toe-to-toe with the big boys on the national stage—literally.DeSantis, for his part, isn't letting this scandal stomp on his spirit. He's been strutting into speeches with more jokes about his footwear than a stand-up comedian at a shoe store. But whether this scandal will scuff his political prospects or just add another inch to his infamous reputation, only time will tell.So, will ""Bootgate"" be the thing that trips up Governor DeSantis, or will he rise above it—elevator shoes and all? Stay tuned, folks. It's Florida, after all, where the only thing higher than the humidity is the next chapter of ""Bootgate."""
