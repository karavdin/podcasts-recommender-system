    "description": "For more than 30 years The\u00a0River\u00a0Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen,\u00a0are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.\u00a0On\u00a0River Cafe Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers\u2014who have become friends\u2014to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. \u201cFoods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,\u201d says Rogers.Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing,\u00a0the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt, and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks.\u00a0Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe\u2019s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.\u00a0For more information, recipes, and ingredients, go to\u00a0https://shoptherivercafe.co.uk/\u00a0Web:\u00a0https://rivercafe.co.uk/Instagram:\u00a0www.instagram.com/therivercafelondon/Facebook:\u00a0https://en-gb.facebook.com/therivercafelondon/\u00a0For more podcasts from iHeartRadio, visit the iheartradio app, apple podcasts, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows.\u00a0Learn more about your ad-choices at\u00a0https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com"

    "description": "Hot and Bothered is all about the power of romance culture. We analyze romance novels and movies to better imagine our own happy endings. Episodes release weekly on Tuesdays.CURRENT SEASON: Hot and Bothered (Movie Edition)We make Hot and Bothered because we are interested in the way that love stories have impacted our lives and culture. For our fifth season of the show, we\u2019re turning our attention to romantic films. Vanessa and Hannah McGregor dig into the canon of romantic films, from\u00a0Titanic\u00a0to\u00a0Twilight\u00a0to\u00a0When Harry Met Sally, (just to name a few). Every other week they do a close scene analysis of how each movie ends, always asking the question \u2018what does this movie believe about love?\u2019SEASON 4: Live from PemberleyIn Live from Pemberley, we continue our deep-dive into the classic texts of romance literature. This season we take a close look at the most famous Romance novel of all time: Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice. Every episode, Vanessa Zoltan and Lauren Sandler read through the book, talk with experts, and ask themselves the question \u2018is this still a story for our time?\u2019SEASON 3: On EyreVanessa Zoltan and journalist Lauren Sandler embark on the English class you always deserved, diving deep into Jane Eyre through the themes of power and desire. Discussions range from ideas of class and colonialism to sex and gender as Lauren and Vanessa explore the roles of oppression and inequality, empowerment and rebellion in the text. Major \u201cEyreheads\u201d and first-time readers alike are invited into Lauren and Vanessa\u2019s conversation as they grapple with this complicated work\u2014and as they try to figure out if Jane Eyre is a book they want to pass on to their daughters, and to future generations.SEASON 2: Twilight in QuarantineYou may remember BFFs Vanessa & Julia from their all-star advice giving in Hot and Bothered Season 1. In this season they\u2019re sheltering in place in different cities, but they\u2019re getting on the phone three times a week to read and talk about Twilight. On Twilight in Quarantine, they work their way through the Twilight saga one chapter at a time, giving brilliant well-informed advice to Stephenie Meyer\u2019s characters along the way. Advice like: \u201chave you considered talking to each other about your feelings?\u201d and \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t kidnap people.\u201dSEASON 1: Writing RomanceSeason one of Hot and Bothered follows ten first-time romance writers as they try to write their own romance novels. Each episode explores a particular romance trope and why we love it so much. Along the way, Julia Quinn, writer of the Bridgerton series, gives weekly assignments so listeners can follow along in the process. Season one was made in collaboration with Spoke Media.Hot & Bothered is produced by Not Sorry Productions, a feminist organization that produces podcasts, educational content, live shows, and immersive experiences with the explicit goal of addressing the spiritual needs of its participants. Through community, rigor, and ritual, we treat traditionally secular things as if they were sacred. To learn more about what we do, visit\u00a0https://notsorryworks.com/ Hosted on Acast.

Instead it\u2019s a show about experiences with literary urge. Join us!  closereads.substack.com"

At the heart of the podcast is the premise that the imaginative, poetic, animate heart of human experience \u2014 elucidated by so many cultures over so many thousands of years \u2014 is missing in modern discourse and is urgently needed at a time when humanity is facing unprecedented problems. The Emerald advocates for an imaginative vision of human life and human discourse as it questions deep underlying assumptions about societal progress."

Agatha Christie, of course: the Queen of Crime, a real-life Dame of the British Empire, and author of sixty-six mystery novels that spanned the Twentieth Century, defining a genre. For five years, Catherine Brobeck and Kemper Donovan revisited these novels in publication order, ranking them according to pre-set criteria (plot, character, etc.). Tragically, Catherine Brobeck passed away at the end of 2021. Since then, Kemper has completed the podcast's ranking project, and now contents himself with celebrating the greatness of Christie by attempting to solve the ultimate mystery where she is concerned. Why Christie--and Christie alone--endures as powerfully as she does."

One of those places was Sam\u2019s childhood home in the English village of Great Chishill, literally called The Pink House. It was a space of total warmth and love where Sam felt safe enough to find their voice. On the podcast, Sam is sitting down with good friends and queer icons to explore their own \u201cPink Houses,\u201d how they navigated early struggles and ultimately found their place in the world. From Elliot Page\u2019s childhood bedroom to Joel Kim Booster\u2019s joyful stint at a Cold Stone Creamery, Sam and their guests bring us transformative stories of belonging, chosen families, and the journeys we take to become who we were destined to be. This series feels like lighting a warm candle and enjoying a cup of tea with a dear friend. Learn how to love yourself, show up for others, and create a world that supports beauty of all kinds.

    "description": "For more than 30 years The\u00a0River\u00a0Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen,\u00a0are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.\u00a0On\u00a0River Cafe Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers\u2014who have become friends\u2014to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. \u201cFoods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,\u201d says Rogers.Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing,\u00a0the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt, and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks.\u00a0Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe\u2019s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.\u00a0For more information, recipes, and ingredients, go to\u00a0https://shoptherivercafe.co.uk/\u00a0Web:\u00a0https://rivercafe.co.uk/Instagram:\u00a0www.instagram.com/therivercafelondon/Facebook:\u00a0https://en-gb.facebook.com/therivercafelondon/\u00a0For more podcasts from iHeartRadio, visit the iheartradio app, apple podcasts, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows.\u00a0Learn more about your ad-choices at\u00a0https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com"

    "description": "Hot and Bothered is all about the power of romance culture. We analyze romance novels and movies to better imagine our own happy endings. Episodes release weekly on Tuesdays.CURRENT SEASON: Hot and Bothered (Movie Edition)We make Hot and Bothered because we are interested in the way that love stories have impacted our lives and culture. For our fifth season of the show, we\u2019re turning our attention to romantic films. Vanessa and Hannah McGregor dig into the canon of romantic films, from\u00a0Titanic\u00a0to\u00a0Twilight\u00a0to\u00a0When Harry Met Sally, (just to name a few). Every other week they do a close scene analysis of how each movie ends, always asking the question \u2018what does this movie believe about love?\u2019SEASON 4: Live from PemberleyIn Live from Pemberley, we continue our deep-dive into the classic texts of romance literature. This season we take a close look at the most famous Romance novel of all time: Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice. Every episode, Vanessa Zoltan and Lauren Sandler read through the book, talk with experts, and ask themselves the question \u2018is this still a story for our time?\u2019SEASON 3: On EyreVanessa Zoltan and journalist Lauren Sandler embark on the English class you always deserved, diving deep into Jane Eyre through the themes of power and desire. Discussions range from ideas of class and colonialism to sex and gender as Lauren and Vanessa explore the roles of oppression and inequality, empowerment and rebellion in the text. Major \u201cEyreheads\u201d and first-time readers alike are invited into Lauren and Vanessa\u2019s conversation as they grapple with this complicated work\u2014and as they try to figure out if Jane Eyre is a book they want to pass on to their daughters, and to future generations.SEASON 2: Twilight in QuarantineYou may remember BFFs Vanessa & Julia from their all-star advice giving in Hot and Bothered Season 1. In this season they\u2019re sheltering in place in different cities, but they\u2019re getting on the phone three times a week to read and talk about Twilight. On Twilight in Quarantine, they work their way through the Twilight saga one chapter at a time, giving brilliant well-informed advice to Stephenie Meyer\u2019s characters along the way. Advice like: \u201chave you considered talking to each other about your feelings?\u201d and \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t kidnap people.\u201dSEASON 1: Writing RomanceSeason one of Hot and Bothered follows ten first-time romance writers as they try to write their own romance novels. Each episode explores a particular romance trope and why we love it so much. Along the way, Julia Quinn, writer of the Bridgerton series, gives weekly assignments so listeners can follow along in the process. Season one was made in collaboration with Spoke Media.Hot & Bothered is produced by Not Sorry Productions, a feminist organization that produces podcasts, educational content, live shows, and immersive experiences with the explicit goal of addressing the spiritual needs of its participants. Through community, rigor, and ritual, we treat traditionally secular things as if they were sacred. To learn more about what we do, visit\u00a0https://notsorryworks.com/ Hosted on Acast.

Brought to life through the wise, wild, and humorous vision of Joshua Michael Schrei \u2014 a teacher and lifelong student of the cosmologies and mythologies of the world \u2014 the podcast draws from a deep well of poetry, lore, and mythos to challenge conventional narratives on politics and public discourse, meditation and mindfulness, art, science, literature, and more. At the heart of the podcast is the premise that the imaginative, poetic, animate heart of human experience \u2014 elucidated by so many cultures over so many thousands of years \u2014 is missing in modern discourse and is urgently needed at a time when humanity is facing unprecedented problems. The Emerald advocates for an imaginative vision of human life and human discourse as it questions deep underlying assumptions about societal progress."

Agatha Christie, of course: the Queen of Crime, a real-life Dame of the British Empire, and author of sixty-six mystery novels that spanned the Twentieth Century, defining a genre. For five years, Catherine Brobeck and Kemper Donovan revisited these novels in publication order, ranking them according to pre-set criteria (plot, character, etc.). Tragically, Catherine Brobeck passed away at the end of 2021. Since then, Kemper has completed the podcast's ranking project, and now contents himself with celebrating the greatness of Christie by attempting to solve the ultimate mystery where she is concerned. Why Christie--and Christie alone--endures as powerfully as she does."

One of those places was Sam\u2019s childhood home in the English village of Great Chishill, literally called The Pink House. It was a space of total warmth and love where Sam felt safe enough to find their voice. On the podcast, Sam is sitting down with good friends and queer icons to explore their own \u201cPink Houses,\u201d how they navigated early struggles and ultimately found their place in the world. From Elliot Page\u2019s childhood bedroom to Joel Kim Booster\u2019s joyful stint at a Cold Stone Creamery, Sam and their guests bring us transformative stories of belonging, chosen families, and the journeys we take to become who we were destined to be. This series feels like lighting a warm candle and enjoying a cup of tea with a dear friend. Learn how to love yourself, show up for others, and create a world that supports beauty of all kinds.

Host Eric Molinsky spent over a decade working as a public radio reporter and producer, and he uses those skills to create thoughtful, sound-rich episodes about science fiction, fantasy, and other genres of speculative fiction. Every other week, he talks with comic book artists, game designers, novelists, screenwriters, filmmakers, and fans about how they craft their worlds, why we suspend our disbelief, and what happens if the spell is broken. Imaginary worlds may be set on distant planets or parallel dimensions, but they are crafted here on Earth, and they\u2019re always about us and our lived experiences."
